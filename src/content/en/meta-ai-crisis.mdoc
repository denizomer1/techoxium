## Meta's AI Crisis

Meta is struggling to retain the AI leaders it recruited with high salaries. This development has created a serious crisis atmosphere within the company.

Mark Zuckerberg's plan to build the "Avengers of AI" team has been shaken by unexpected departures. Some key figures transferred from competitors for hundreds of millions of dollars left Meta within just a few months. This situation has caused widespread repercussions in the tech world.

### Key Figures Returned

Researchers Avi Verma, Ethan Knight, and Rishabh Agarwal who joined Meta resigned shortly after. Particularly, Avi Verma and Ethan Knight, transferred from OpenAI, chose to return to their former companies after staying only a few weeks. Chaya Navak, who had been working at Meta for a long time, also left to join the OpenAI team. The fact that these individuals left behind quite advantageous contracts has drawn attention.

### Reasons for Departures

No official reason was announced, but rumors suggest that Mark Zuckerberg's "interfering in everything" management style disturbed the team. Additionally, differences in Meta and OpenAI's approaches to AI and ethical frameworks may have contributed to this mismatch.

### Uncertain Future

Meta's recent decision to restructure the "Superintelligence Labs" team and stop hiring actually shows that these problems were noticed beforehand. The recent departures have further increased question marks about the team's future.
