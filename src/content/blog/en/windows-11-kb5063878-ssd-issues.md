Microsoft began rolling out KB5063878 for Windows 11 24H2 last Tuesday to fix sign-in delays on new devices. Since the update some users report major errors with SSD storage drives, including performance drops and freezes.

Quick steps:

- If you experience SSD problems after the update, roll back the update (Settings > System > Recovery) and check for firmware updates from your drive manufacturer.
- Run `chkdsk /f` to check for disk errors and contact vendor support if issues persist.

This notice is based on early user reports; until Microsoft or drive vendors release an official fix, consider delaying the update on critical systems.
