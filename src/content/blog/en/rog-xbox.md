After Xbox's console-side initiative with Xbox Series S and X, Xbox is preparing to transition to a new system. With the new announcement, Microsoft is collaborating with AMD to make the Xbox brand available everywhere and make gaming accessible anywhere.

This partnership suggests that the next Xbox console could be closer to PC and might offer the ability to play games from Steam, GOG, and Epic Games all in one place. According to Microsoft, the Rog Xbox Ally operating system will be a customized version of Windows 11, providing gamers with more features and capabilities.

The Rog Xbox Ally draws its power from AMD's next-generation RDNA2 architecture-based AMD Ryzen Z2 processor. With this processor offering 1.6 TFLOPS of processing power, you can play next-generation games. Xbox library can be accessed from anywhere.

The Rog Xbox Ally and Rog Xbox Ally X are expected to launch this New Year's.
